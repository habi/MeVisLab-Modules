# MeVisLab Modules

During my PhD at the [Institute of Anatomy](http://ana.unibe.ch) of the [University of Bern](http://unibe.ch) I was running a SVN repository server on the [virtual server infrastructure](http://www.id.unibe.ch/content/services/hosting/virtuelle_server/) of the University of Bern.

Since I'm no longer working there I migrated all the code to GitHub, using `git svn clone http://code.ana.unibe.ch/svn/RepositoryName`

During my PhD I worked intensively with [MeVisLab](http://mevislab.de), for visualization of tomographic data, analysis of images and to make nice images for presentations.
This repository contains a try I made to develop our own MeVisLab module.
